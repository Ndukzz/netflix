# minimatch

A minimal matching utility.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch)


This is the matching library used internally by npm.

It works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`
objects.

## Usage

```javascript
var minimatch = require("minimatch")

minimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo") // true!
minimatch("bar.foo", "*.bar") // false!
minimatch("bar.foo", "*.+(bar|foo)", { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!
```

## Features

Supports these glob features:

* Brace Expansion
* Extended glob matching
* "Globstar" `**` matching

See:

* `man sh`
* `man bash`
* `man 3 fnmatch`
* `man 5 gitignore`

## Windows

**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**

Though windows uses either `/` or `\` as its path separator, only `/`
characters are used by this glob implementation.  You must use
forward-slashes **only** in glob expressions.  Back-slashes in patterns
will always be interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.

Note that `\` or `/` _will_ be interpreted as path separators in paths on
Windows, and will match against `/` in glob expressions.

So just always use `/` in patterns.
